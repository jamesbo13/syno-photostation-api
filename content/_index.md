# Introduction #

This document contains notes on the REST API used by Synology PhotoStation
application. There is no public documentation from Synology on this API so
this is an unofficial attempt to fill that void.

Documentation comes from examining Synology PhotoStation code (accessible
on a running Synology NAS when logged in via ssh), tracing HTTP requests
via wireshark and trial-and-error attempts to replicate via curl and other
tools.
