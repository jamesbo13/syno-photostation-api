This section provides a basic overview of the PhotoStation API and how one should use it.

## API Workflow ##

The PhotoStation API mimics other service APIs from Synology (eg. FileStation) in
using the following basic workflow:

1. [Get API information](./get-api-info)
2. [Session login](./session-login)
3. [Perform an API request](./perform-request)
4. [Parse API response](./parse-request)
5. [Session logout](./session-logout)

Each of these steps will be explained in further detail along with examples using
[curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) in the following sections.
